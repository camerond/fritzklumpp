          <h1>Meet Fritz</h1>
          <p>A native of New Orleans, Fritz graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1961 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Naval Science. Following his commissioning as an officer, he reported to Pensacola, Florida and completed Naval Flight Training in 1962. He earned a Master’s Degree from Liberty University in 1993.</p>

          <p>Upon completion of flight training, Fritz’s initial assignment was as a fighter pilot flying the F-4 Phantom with Fighter Squadron 114, stationed aboard the U.S.S. Kittyhawk. He flew a total of 136 combat missions in Vietnam and completed over 350 carrier landings.</p>
          <p>While flying over North Vietnam, he was shot down by anti-aircraft fire on his 30th mission, was rescued and was back in the cockpit two days later. He went on to fly 106 more combat missions before returning to the United States. Following Vietnam, he served the Navy at McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis, Mo. where he flight-tested the F-4 Phantom jet for military acceptance.</p>

          <p>While serving in St. Louis, Fritz made the decision to resign his commission in protest over the government’s “no-win” policy, the failure of our nation’s leaders to do anything to insure a timely release of the POWs, and the fact that the war was being micro-managed from the White House. His military decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross, eleven awards of the Air Medal, and the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor.</p>

          <p>For almost 30 years Fritz was a pilot for Delta Airlines. With Delta he served as a Senior Flight Instructor, a Line Captain and a Check Pilot on the Boeing 757/767 aircraft. He retired from Delta in July, 1997, completing his professional flying career with over 20,000 hours of flight time. Since retirement from Delta, Fritz has offered consulting, training, and personal development to individual companies and ministries through Triad Resources.</p>
          <p>Fritz began public speaking as a motivational/inspirational speaker in 1973 and has spoken to men and women around the world. He served as associate staff with CBMC of USA, a non-profit ministry to business and professional men, training both individuals and couples in the principles of lifestyle evangelism. Fritz also served on the Board of Directors of CBMC and after retiring from Delta, served as Executive Director of CBMC from 2000 to 2003. During his time as Executive Director, his executive team was responsible for developing a fresh vision and restoring the organization to financial viability.</p>
